# hearts-java

This was my first project in Java: Creating the card game [Hearts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lady).

After getting most of this up and running (still some features missing, but you can play a slightly reduced game), I started again from scratch.
See [hearts-java-v2](https://github.com/kr-matthews/hearts-java-v2).

### Play

I would recommend playing the second version, linked above, instead of this one.
